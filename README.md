# Goal
This code was made for Exercise sheet one of the course "Debugging and Fuzzing".

# Setup
I am working on Windows 10 (shame on my), that's why the make-file is a bit weird.
I am using tcc, dunno why, started it years ago.

# Challenges
It was hard for me to write code that works and then figuring out ways to manipulate it, to get an creative error.
Errors that have been added:

* isSorted accepts descending as well as ascending sorting.
* SortArray might try to flip the last element with one outside the array
* BinarySearch possibly gets stuck and does not find the element it is looking for. Yet this error can not be found by my "random" unit-tests.

I had to modify the functions given in the exercise sheet, since giving an array to a function in C makes it a pointer, and so it's not possible to get the size of an array.

This exercise sheet took me about 7 hours, since I am not used to program C outside of small Microcontrollers.
I usually do only work with fixed array sizes and I usually only call functions with pointers to custom objects, not arrays.
Quite a different experience to what I am used to when programming C. :)

Reminds me why I love my embedded stuff on tiny controllers: I can do a 100% Coverage-Test of nearly all functions within seconds. :)
